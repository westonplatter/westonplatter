# Hi, I'm Weston

I work on Infrastructure projects at [Masterpoint Consulting](https://github.com/masterpointio). We're incredibly at helping clients think about and implement IaC at scale. 

I love writing code and crafting a solution for the specific problem at hand.

As a former quant developer, I still enjoy working with options, futures, volatility risk data.
