# Hi, I'm Weston

I work on Infrastructure projects at [Masterpoint Consulting](https://github.com/masterpointio). We're experienced at helping clients think about, revise, and implement their Infrastucture as Code at scale.

I love writing code and crafting solutions for the specific problem at hand. As a former quant developer, I still enjoy working with options, futures, volatility risk data (checkout [nextgentr8der](https://github.com/westonplatter/nextgentr8der)!).
